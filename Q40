40. Solve the problem of finding the element with maximum frequency in an array. Write 
its algorithm, program. Find its time and space complexities. Explain with suitable 
example

Algorithm:
Use a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to store the frequency of each element.

Iterate through the array:

For each element, increment its count in the map.

Track the element with the maximum frequency while building the map.


Program:-
int findMaxFrequencyElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    int maxFreq = 0;
    int maxFreqElement = nums[0];

    for (int num : nums) {
        freq[num]++;
        if (freq[num] > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freq[num];
            maxFreqElement = num;
        }
    }

    return maxFreqElement;
}


Time Complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(m)

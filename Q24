24. Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design. 

Bit manipulation refers to the technique of performing operations on individual bits of data (binary digits, 0 or 1) within integers or other binary structures. In bit manipulation, you use bitwise operators to directly manipulate the bits of a number. These operators allow you to perform various operations efficiently at the bit level.

The most common bitwise operators are:

AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.

OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.

XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1 (but not both).

NOT (~): Inverts all the bits.

Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying by 2^n.

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing by 2^n.

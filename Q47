47. Explain the concept of histogram problems and their applications in algorithm design. 

A histogram represents bars with different heights.

A typical histogram problem in algorithms is about finding the largest rectangle that can be formed between the bars.

Each bar has a unit width, and we are asked to find areas based on the heights

Application	                                            Description
Stack Usage	                                Use stacks to find nearest smaller elements on the left and right.
Largest Rectangle in Binary Matrix	        Reduce the 2D matrix to multiple histogram problems row by row.
Skyline Problems	                         Histogram techniques help in merging building heights efficiently.
Histogram Area Problems	                   Used in image processing, architecture modeling.

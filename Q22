22. How to check if a number is a power of two using bit manipulation. Write its algorithm, 
program. Find its time and space complexities. Explain with suitable example. 

Algorithm:-
1. If n <= 0, return False (not a power of two).
2. If n & (n - 1) == 0, return True (it is a power of two).
3. Otherwise, return False.


Program:-
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return (n > 0) && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

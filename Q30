30. Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design.  

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are linked using pointers.
Each node contains two parts: Data: The actual value.
Pointer (or reference): The address of the next node in the list.

Type	                  Description
Singly Linked List   	Each node points to the next node.
Doubly Linked List	  Each node points to both next and previous nodes.
Circular Linked List	Last node points back to the head (first node).

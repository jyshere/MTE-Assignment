*Q.Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems*


The Sliding Window is a technique used to reduce the time complexity of problems that involve contiguous sequences, like subarrays or substrings.
Instead of checking every possible window from scratch, we "slide" a fixed-size or dynamic window across the data and update the result efficiently.

Problems involving substrings or subarrays
You need to find:
Maximum/minimum sum
Length of longest/shortest substring
